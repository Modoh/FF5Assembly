;Knives damage formula
;Tweaks:
;Power Drink fix and related changes to account for possible attack power overflow
;Fixes agi bug where it ignored high byte of result
;Reduced stat scaling to /256 instead of /128 and changes static value to 3 to offset rounding loss
;Goal is to restore bugged str/agi scaling without also making them too good and overshadow str weapons for str classes

;Fixes:
;Simply fixing the obvious knife bug makes them very overpowered with the attack values the game uses
;so I'm making the judgement call of using the combat tweaks formula as a fix

;optimizations:
;uses utility routines to save space over original
;if not using fixes, a shorter method is used to get the original bugged agi behavior

;Attack = Attack Power + 0..3
;M = Level*Strength/256 + Level*Agility/256 + 3
